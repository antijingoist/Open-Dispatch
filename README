Tools and snippets for a decentralized dispatch.

Basic, very basic setup is-> phone app + receiver.

Receiver is receiver.php + emc_config right now. Phone app sends "coordinate" to receiver. Receiver sends an email for you (this avoids low signal time taken up by authenticating places, etc.) Receiver will also set a token on the server.

Set up is all on the user currently, but it should be simple to aggregate all these dispatches using the tokens (coming later).

First steps: 
- make the receiver and phone app work consistently.
- Crossplatform the phone apps
- Add true facebook and twitter support. Currently supported via email at the moment. 
- Then plugins, etc.
