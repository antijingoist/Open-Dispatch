{"name":"Open-dispatch","body":"Tools and snippets for a decentralized dispatch.\r\n\r\nBasic, very basic setup is-> phone app + receiver.\r\n\r\nReceiver is receiver.php + emc_config right now. Phone app sends \"coordinate\" to receiver. Receiver sends an email for you (this avoids low signal time taken up by authenticating places, etc.) Receiver will also set a token on the server.\r\n\r\nSet up is all on the user currently, but it should be simple to aggregate all these dispatches using the tokens (coming later).\r\n\r\nFirst steps: \r\n- make the receiver and phone app work consistently.\r\n- Crossplatform the phone apps\r\n- Add true facebook and twitter support. Currently supported via email at the moment. \r\n- Then plugins, etc.","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
